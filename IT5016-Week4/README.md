## Overview
This repository contains Python programs developed as part of the **Week 4 Lab Activities** for the IT5016 Software Development Fundamentals course.  
The objective of these exercises is to strengthen understanding of **function definitions**, **parameters**, **return values**, and **code modularity** through structured examples.

Each Python file represents a focused example that demonstrates how to define, call, and reuse functions effectively to solve basic computational problems.

## Task Summaries

### Task 1 - Function Definition and Execution
**File:** 'Week4_Task_1_Function.py'  
This script introduces the concept of function creation and execution.  
It defines two simple functions:
- 'greet()' - prints a welcome message to the user.  
- 'add_numbers()' - performs addition of two fixed numbers and returns the result.  

The main program calls these functions sequentially to demonstrate **basic function invocation and return value usage**

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Function definition using 'def'  
- Calling and returning values  
- Sequential program structure  

---

### Task 2 - Parameterized Functions (Example 1)
**File:** 'Week4_Task_2_Exampl1.py'  
Demonstrates **function parameters** by defining a function 'greet(name, message)' that takes two arguments and prints a personalized message.  
For example, it greets "Alice" and "Bob" using customized messages like "Welcome to Python" and "Good morning" respectively

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Parameters and arguments  
- String formatting with f-strings  
- Code reusability with function calls  

---

### Task 2 - Parameterized Functions (Example 2)
**File:** 'Week4_Task_2_Exampl2.py'  
An extension of the previous example, this program introduces multiple parameters and performs numerical calculations within functions.  
It emphasizes passing values dynamically and reusing the same function for different inputs, reinforcing modular and reusable programming design.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Multiple arguments in functions  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Dynamic computation  

---

### Task 3 - Function Composition (Example 1)
**File:** 'Week4_Task_3_Exampl1.py'  
Focuses on **function composition**, where one function calls another to achieve a combined outcome.  
For instance, a function may calculate a mathematical result, and another function prints that result in a formatted way.  
This promotes **hierarchical function design** and **clear code separation** between logic and output.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Calling functions from within other functions  
- Layered design and composition  
- Improved maintainability  

---

### Task 3 - Function Composition (Example 2)
**File:** 'Week4_Task_3_Exampl2.py'  
Builds on Example 1 by integrating multiple helper functions that interact to produce a single result.  
It illustrates how modular design supports debugging, scalability, and code readability by breaking complex processes into smaller, manageable pieces.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Function nesting  
- Logical organization  
- Modular software design  

---

### Task 4 - Combined Function Example
**File:** 'Week4_Task_4_Exampl1.py'  
A consolidated example showcasing the **practical use of functions** for structured programming.  
This task ties together earlier concepts - from defining reusable functions to handling arguments and returning values.  
It highlights the importance of designing **self-contained functions** that can be tested and reused independently.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Function combination and reuse  
- Return values in real-world scenarios  
- Clean, modular programming

## Programming Principles Reinforced

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Modularity** | Each function performs a distinct task, making the code easier to understand and maintain. |
| **Reusability** | Functions can be invoked multiple times with different inputs to produce dynamic outputs. |
| **Readability** | Meaningful names, comments, and indentation make the code self-explanatory. |
| **Abstraction** | Functions hide internal implementation details, allowing higher-level program flow to remain simple. |
| **Composition** | Combining functions supports the development of scalable, layered logic. |

## Reflection
The Week 4 lab activities reinforced practical application of **function-based design**.  
Through iterative tasks, the exercises demonstrated how functions simplify complex logic, reduce redundancy, and improve clarity.  
Learning to structure programs in smaller, testable components built a strong foundation for later topics like parameter passing, recursion, and modular system design.
