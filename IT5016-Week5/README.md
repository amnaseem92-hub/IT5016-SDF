##  Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python programs developed as part of the **Week 5 Lab Activities** for the IT5016 Software Development Fundamentals course.  
The exercises demonstrate fundamental programming principles using **functions**, **parameters**, **loops**, and **conditional logic**.  
Each file ('sn1.py' - 'sn7.py') represents a different scenario that progressively strengthens problem-solving and function-based programming skills.

##  Activity Summaries

###  sn1.py - Basic Function Definition and Calling
This program defines a simple function named 'greet()' that prints a welcome message.  
It demonstrates the structure of a function definition, indentation, and multiple function calls to reinforce code reuse and readability

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Function definition using 'def'  
- Print statements  
- Repeated function invocation  

---

###  sn2.py - Function with Parameters
This script introduces **parameterized functions** by defining 'greet_user(name)' to print a personalized message.  
It shows how arguments can be passed to a function to make it dynamic and reusable across different inputs

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Function parameters and arguments  
- String formatting using f-strings  
- Dynamic message generation  

---

###  sn3.py - Returning Values from Functions
The program defines a function 'square(x)' that calculates and returns the square of a number.  
It demonstrates how to capture function return values and reuse them in expressions or print statements.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Use of the 'return' statement  
- Mathematical operations within functions  
- Reusability and modular computation  

---

###  sn4.py - Function with Multiple Parameters
Defines a function 'add_numbers(a, b)' that returns the sum of two numbers.  
The activity emphasizes how functions can accept multiple arguments and return a single computed value.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Multiple parameter handling  
- Arithmetic addition and formatted output  
- Understanding of input-output data flow  

---

###  sn5.py - Default Arguments in Functions
Introduces the concept of **default parameter values** through a function 'power(base, exponent=2)'.  
The function calculates 'base ** exponent', illustrating flexibility when some arguments are optional.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Default parameter values  
- Exponentiation operator ('**')  
- Function flexibility and reusability  

---

###  sn6.py - Problem-Solving Functions
This script includes multiple small yet logical functions:
1. 'is_even(n)' - Returns 'True' if a number is even.  
2. 'find_max(a, b, c)' - Determines the largest among three numbers.  
3. 'factorial(n)' - Calculates factorial iteratively.  

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Conditional evaluation  
- Loop constructs ('for', 'while')  
- Algorithmic problem solving  

---

###  sn7.py - Simple Calculator Using Functions
A menu-driven calculator program that allows users to select an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and perform calculations using respective functions.  
It includes basic error handling to prevent division by zero and provides clear user interaction prompts.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Modular program design  
- Function-based logic separation  
- Input validation and decision control

##  Programming Principles Reinforced
| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Modularity** | Breaking large problems into smaller, manageable functions. |
| **Reusability** | Functions are designed to perform specific tasks and can be reused multiple times. |
| **Input Validation** | Ensuring accurate and safe handling of user inputs. |
| **Abstraction** | Hiding complex logic within function definitions for clarity. |
| **Code Readability** | Proper naming conventions, indentation, and comments for easy understanding. |

##  Reflection
These Week 5 activities reinforced key programming habits - writing clean, modular, and reusable functions.  
Understanding **parameter passing**, **return statements**, and **decision logic** provided a strong foundation for developing structured Python programs.
