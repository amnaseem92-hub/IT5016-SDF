## ----  Overview
This README presents the logical structure and process flow for three foundational Python programming activities.  
Each activity demonstrates a core programming concept using **functions**, represented through **flowcharts** and implemented in simple Python scripts.  

The goal is to visualize how input, processing, and output occur within different types of functions.

##  Activity 1 - Defining and Calling Functions
**Purpose:**  
To understand how a function is defined and executed multiple times.

**Flow Summary:**  
1. **Start** the process.  
2. Define the function `greet()` that displays `"Hello, welcome to Python lab!"`.  
3. **Call** the function three times to repeat the message.  
4. **End** the program.

**Key Learning:**  
This flowchart shows the concept of **function reuse** - once defined, a function can be invoked multiple times without rewriting the code.
