## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python programs developed during **Week 3 Lab Sessions** of the IT5016 course.  
Each script demonstrates a unique Python concept, reinforcing fundamental programming constructs such as **list manipulation**, **loops**, **string processing**, and **function implementation**.

These exercises simulate real-world problem-solving tasks and gradually strengthen understanding of how algorithms interact with data structures and user input.

##  Scenario Summaries

###  Scenario 1 - Parking Meter Calculation
**File:** 'Week3_LabSession_Scen1.py'  
Simulates a parking meter where users enter the number of parking hours. The program calculates the total cost based on a fixed rate for the first three hours and a reduced rate for subsequent hours.  

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Conditional logic ('if-else')  
- Arithmetic expressions  
- User input and formatted output  

---

###  Scenario 2 - Average of Numbers
**File:** 'Week3_LabSession_Scen2.py'  
Collects a list of user-provided numbers and calculates their average. It introduces basic aggregation logic using Python's 'sum()' and 'len()' functions.  

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- List creation and traversal  
- Input validation  
- Aggregation using built-in functions  

---

###  Scenario 3 - Find Maximum Number
**File:** 'Week3_LabSession_Scen3.py'  
Prompts the user to enter several numbers and outputs the highest value.  
Demonstrates use of Python's 'max()' function and conditional evaluation for data comparison.  

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Loops and iteration  
- Use of built-in functions  
- Conditional analysis  

---

###  Scenario 4 - Reverse a String
**File:** 'Week3_LabSession_Scen4.py'  
Takes an input string from the user and reverses it using slicing.  
Illustrates Python's indexing and string immutability properties.  

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- String slicing  
- Input/output handling  
- Algorithmic thinking  

---

###  Scenario 5 - Factorial Calculator
**File:** 'Week3_LabSession_Scen5.py'  
Computes the factorial of a number using a loop structure. This exercise reinforces iterative logic and multiplication-based accumulation.  

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- For loops  
- Accumulator variables  
- Mathematical computation logic  

---

###  Scenario 6 - Multiplication Table Generator
**File:** 'Week3_LabSession_Scen6.py'  
Displays a multiplication table for any number entered by the user.  
This task emphasizes repetitive execution and structured formatting of numeric results.  

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Iteration with 'for' loops  
- Dynamic print formatting  
- Arithmetic operations  

---

###  Scenario 7 - Swapping List Elements
**File:** 'Week3_LabSession_Scen7.py'  
Defines a function 'swapPositions(List, pos1, pos2)' that swaps two elements in a list based on provided indices.  
Demonstrates function creation, parameter passing, and return values

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Functions and arguments  
- Index manipulation  
- Mutable data structures  

---

###  Scenario 8 - Counting Vowels in a Word
**File:** 'Week3_LabSession_Scen8.py'  
Accepts a string and counts how many vowels it contains. The program handles both uppercase and lowercase input.  

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Loops and conditionals  
- String membership operations ('in')  
- Counting and conditional accumulation  

---

###  Scenario 9 - Sum of Even Numbers
**File:** 'Week3_LabSession_Scen9.py'  
Generates a list of even numbers up to a given limit and calculates their sum.  
This highlights loop control, arithmetic filtering, and aggregation.  

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Range iteration  
- Conditional selection ('if n % 2 == 0')  
- Summation logic  

---

###  Scenario 10 - Display List of Fruits
**File:** 'Week3_LabSession_Scen10.py'  
Stores a list of fruits and prints each item using a loop.  
Demonstrates simple iteration and collection traversal.  

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Lists and iteration  
- For-loop processing  
- Basic data presentation  

---

###  Scenario 11 - Grade Classification
**File:** 'Week3_LabSession_Scen11.py'  
Allows user input of a score and classifies it into categories (Excellent, Good, Average, or Fail).  
This scenario integrates multiple condition checks for classification boundaries.  

**Concepts Demonstrated:**  
- Conditional ranges  
- Nested decision-making  
- User interaction  

---

##  Programming Concepts Reinforced
| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Input Handling** | Safely collects data from users and converts it into appropriate types. |
| **Loops** | Automates repetition for mathematical and data-driven tasks. |
| **Conditional Logic** | Directs program flow based on logical decisions. |
| **Functions** | Modularizes code into reusable components. |
| **Data Structures** | Utilizes lists and strings effectively for dynamic processing. |

---

## Reflection
Completing these scenarios improved understanding of **Python control flow**, **data iteration**, and **error handling**.  
Practical applications such as factorial calculations, list processing, and grading systems show how simple programming logic translates into usable software features.  
Each exercise served as a foundation for more advanced algorithmic and modular programming concepts introduced later in the course.
